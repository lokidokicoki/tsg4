# Gack

Gack represents different hazards in the World. Gack is immobile and potentially impenetrable to Things.

It comes in 3 flavours:

- WetGack: its blue and wet. WetGackStuff grows here. Reduces movement rate.
- DryGack: its yellow and hot. DryGackStuff grows here. Increase energy cost to move.
- BadGack: its red and spicy. No Stuff grows here. Mutagenic. Rare.

Things have their Factors jumbled, and can acquire Traits, through spawning or coming into contact with BadGack.
